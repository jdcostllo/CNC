The original development blog for the CNC shield can be found [here](https://blog.protoneer.co.nz/arduino-cnc-shield/).

Some basic code can be found 
[here](https://www.aranacorp.com/en/using-an-arduino-cnc-shield-v3/). I 
suggest using this code only to identify the pins on the CNC shield and 
inputting those pin values into your own script, built from the TMC2208 
examples.

### Stepper Motor

Anet Stepper Motor 42SHDC3025-24B

The stepper motor was salvaged from Jeff's original ALUNAR Anet A8 purchased in May 2017 from Amazon. The motor is known to have a non-standard wiring pinout and cannot be plugged directly into the V3 CNC Shield using the stepper motor cable.

Refer to both the image and table above for the specific wiring for the Anet stepper. If you're using a different stepper motor, be sure to check its specific wiring diagram before connecting it to the CNC Shield.

### Servo Motor (Pen Actuator)

## Wiring

1. Install the CNC Shield on top of the Arduino UNO.
1. Install the TMC2208 into the CNC Shield. Orient the TMC2208 such that the enable pin ("EN") on the driver matches the enable pin ("EN") on the CNC Shield.
1. Install the heat sink on the TMC2208 if it is not already installed.
1. Refer to Table 1. With the CNC Shield oriented upright, so the text on the board is legible, connect the stepper motor wires to CNC Shield in the order A+, A-, B+, B- following the configuration of the aftermarket cable. This will likely require additional jumpers or modifications to the existing cable, as the order will likely be wrong. 

**Note to Self:** I removed the existing 4-slot dupont connector on the cable and used my 1-slot dupont connectors to separate the cable into four individual wires. This way, I can make my wiring connections as desired.




## Software

### Verify Board and Stepper Wiring

Script: `TMC2208 with V3 CNC Shield/TMC2208_Example/TMC2208_Example.ino`

The TMC2208 driver has a library within the Arduino IDE with provided examples. Version 0.2.5 is latest at time of 
this README. The INO file `TMC2208_Example.ino` is a modified version of the example code from the TMC2208 Arduino Library.

For this file, connect your stepper motor and stepper driver to the Y-Axis of the CNC Shield.

### GRBL

## GRBL Configuration Modification

You must edit the following files in your library in order to get the correct behavior of the SG90 servo. By default the TCCRB timer on the arduino has a PWM which is wayyyy too fast for the SG90 servo. By changing the onboard timer prescaler, we can achieve a slower PWM which actually works with the SG90. Check out this [link](https://github.com/grbl/grbl/issues/328) to show the available prescaler settings. Then, make the appropriate edits in the `spindle_control.c` file. Or, I have captioned the prescaler settings below from the forum responder `EliteEng con Jan 9, 2014`:

```
The per scaler of timer2 is currently set to 8 ( 16MHz / 8 = 2MHz )

Other per scalers available on timer2 are 1,8,32,64,128,256,1024 ( data sheet pg 162 http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc8161.pdf)

Setting Divisor
0x01 1
0x02 8
0x03 32
0x04 64
0x05 128
0x06 256
0x07 1024

Change the setting value of line 76 in spindle_control.c

TCCRB_REGISTER = (TCCRB_REGISTER & 0b11111000) | 0x02; // set to 1/8 Prescaler
^
```



The main directory grbl library is as follows on Windows:
`Documents\Arduino\libraries\grbl`



First, ensure variable spindle is enabled in the `config.h` file. This allows D11 to act in PWM mode. In Jeff's original installation, this was already enabled by default. Still, I am including this below.

`Documents\Arduino\libraries\grbl\config.h`

```
// Enables variable spindle output voltage for different RPM values. On the Arduino Uno, the spindle
// enable pin will output 5V for maximum RPM with 256 intermediate levels and 0V when disabled.
// NOTE: IMPORTANT for Arduino Unos! When enabled, the Z-limit pin D11 and spindle enable pin D12 switch!
// The hardware PWM output on pin D11 is required for variable spindle output voltages.
#define VARIABLE_SPINDLE // Default enabled. Comment to disable.
```
Then, change the timer prescaler to get the desired, slower PWM for controlling the SG90 servo.
`Documents\Arduino\libraries\grbl\spindle_control.c`

Original:
```
    #ifdef VARIABLE_SPINDLE
      // TODO: Install the optional capability for frequency-based output for servos.
      #ifdef CPU_MAP_ATMEGA2560
      	TCCRA_REGISTER = (1<<COMB_BIT) | (1<<WAVE1_REGISTER) | (1<<WAVE0_REGISTER);
        TCCRB_REGISTER = (TCCRB_REGISTER & 0b11111000) | 0x02 | (1<<WAVE2_REGISTER) | (1<<WAVE3_REGISTER); // set to 1/8 Prescaler
        OCR4A = 0xFFFF; // set the top 16bit value
        uint16_t current_pwm;
      #else
        TCCRA_REGISTER = (1<<COMB_BIT) | (1<<WAVE1_REGISTER) | (1<<WAVE0_REGISTER);
        TCCRB_REGISTER = (TCCRB_REGISTER & 0b11111000) | 0x02; // set to 1/8 Prescaler
        uint8_t current_pwm;
      #endif
```

Modified:

```
    #ifdef VARIABLE_SPINDLE
      // TODO: Install the optional capability for frequency-based output for servos.
      #ifdef CPU_MAP_ATMEGA2560
      	TCCRA_REGISTER = (1<<COMB_BIT) | (1<<WAVE1_REGISTER) | (1<<WAVE0_REGISTER);
        TCCRB_REGISTER = (TCCRB_REGISTER & 0b11111000) | 0x07 | (1<<WAVE2_REGISTER) | (1<<WAVE3_REGISTER); // set to 1/8 Prescaler
        OCR4A = 0xFFFF; // set the top 16bit value
        uint16_t current_pwm;
      #else
        TCCRA_REGISTER = (1<<COMB_BIT) | (1<<WAVE1_REGISTER) | (1<<WAVE0_REGISTER);
        TCCRB_REGISTER = (TCCRB_REGISTER & 0b11111000) | 0x07; // set to 1/8 Prescaler
        uint8_t current_pwm;
      #endif
```

After these changes are made to the GRBL library, recompile and reupload to the arduino using your preferred IDE.
